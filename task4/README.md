# Technology used : HTML , CSS , JavaScript

This is my first project & of course it is for programmers :)
during solving problems on Codechef & Codeforces , I realised we often needs to calculate 
or ( a | b ) , xor ( a ^ b ) , and ( a & b ) of two numbers and by doing these things manually it takes lot of time , so I made a solution for this where we can calculate 
a xor b , a and b , a or b easily.
